# SolidCake420 Home Assistant Configuration

Hi, I've been playing with Home Assistant for about a month now, please feel free to use any of my stuff.

The setup is still a bit messy, as I have a lot of things WIP or pending for hardware.

PS: lovelace-ui.yaml should be copied to Lovelace UI Raw Config Editor


If you want to buy me a coffee, that would be much appreciated. :)
